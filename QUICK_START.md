  "spawn_height": 1,
  "companion_speed": 0.4,
  "item_pickup_range": 3,

}
```

- **Spawn Height**: 1 block above ground
- **Speed**: 0.4 (same as players)
- **Pickup Range**: 3 blocks
- **Render Range**: 64 blocks

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Menu doesn't open (Press H does nothing)
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in a world
2. Check mod is loaded in logs
3. Try re-binding the key in controls
4. Verify Fabric API is installed

### Problem: Characters won't load
**Solution:**
1. Wait 10+ seconds - loading takes time
2. Check internet connection
3. Check mod logs for errors
4. Restart Minecraft

### Problem: Companion won't spawn
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're close to ground
2. Check companion isn't already spawned
3. Check mod logs
4. Try different character

### Problem: Companion stuck or not moving
**Solution:**
1. Move away and back
2. Dismiss and re-summon
3. Reload world
4. Check for obstacles

### Problem: Items not being picked up
**Solution:**
1. Items must be within 3 blocks
2. Companion might be busy
3. Inventory might be full
4. Check game rule: `mobGriefing` is enabled

### Problem: Performance issues / Lag
**Solution:**
1. Reduce render distance (Ctrl+F3+G)
2. Dismiss extra companions
3. Close other applications
4. Update GPU drivers

## Chat Commands

**These depend on Player2 API character configuration:**

```
# Examples (character-dependent):
"Alex, gather 10 wood"
"Alex, follow me"
"Alex, wait here"
"Alex, attack that zombie"
"Alex, come back"
"Alex, go to 100 200 300"
```

**Note:** Exact commands depend on character definition and AI capabilities.

## World Settings

### Recommended Settings
```
Difficulty: Hard (more challenge)
PvP: Enabled (if testing combat)
Mobs: Enabled (for gathering tasks)
Fire Spread: Enabled (for realistic environment)
```

### Gamerules
- `mobGriefing` - Should be `true` for item pickup
- `showDeathMessages` - For debugging crashes

## Performance Tips

1. **Lower companion render range**
   - Further away = less rendering
   - Only render nearby companions

2. **Limit companions**
   - 1-3 companions ideal
   - Each adds rendering/AI overhead
   - More = more lag

3. **Disable unnecessary features**
   - Hunger system is disabled by default (good!)
   - Only enable if needed

4. **Optimize Minecraft**
   - 60+ FPS recommended
   - 8GB+ RAM recommended
   - Good GPU helps with rendering

## Advanced: Building Custom Characters

**Coming Soon:** Character customization guide

- Names
- Personalities
- Appearances
- Skills
- Behaviors

## FAQ
